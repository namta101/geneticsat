# Running the solver using an IDE (such as IntelliJ)

It is recommended to run the solver using an IDE, as this will take care of compilation/building the solver. 

1. Unzip the folder
2. Open up the folder in the chosen IDE
3. To build, you must have installed the junit-jupiter 5.42 library: which can be installed from the Maven Repository (this is to run the unit tests).
4. **MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE WORKING DIRECTORY**
 - The Working Directory should match to where the Main file is held: 
 - For example if the project is placed in directory *IdeaProjects*, then the likely directory needed is /Users/yourName/IdeaProjects/geneticsat/satsolver/src
 - Typically the working directory is by default  /Users/nam/IdeaProjects/geneticsat/, so simply add on satsolver/src
5. Edit Program arguments as wanted (details below 'Arguments for Solver') 
6. Run the program



# Running the Solver from terminal

1. Unzip the folder
2. Navigate to the directory **geneticsat/satsolver/src/**
3. Compile all files using **javac src/*.java**
4. Run using java src/Main {Arguments}

## Arguments for the Solver

There are two sets of arguments you can give to the solver. 1 Argument if there is already a given problem or 3 Arguments if you wish to generate a new problem to solve. 

### Solving an existing/given problem

There are multiple examples given in the cnf folder of various problem sizes.
These examples are named X.Y.no.cnf, where X is the number of variables, Y the number of clauses. 
If you wish to submit your own problem, simply place the file inside this folder (the file must be in DIMACS format - look at the examples for help)

1. To run, simply type java src/Main {name of file}
 - For example: *java src/Main 10.15.1.cnf*

### Solving a randomly generated problem 

If instead you wish to generate a new randomly generated problem:

1. To run, simply type java src/Main {fileName} {numberOfVariables} {numberOfClauses}
 - For example: *java src/Main test.cnf 30 50*

This will generate a random 3-SAT problem depending on the number of variables and clauses given, and immediately start solving it. It will also generate a file to hold this problem and the results which will be stored in the cnf folder under *fileName*

## Output

During solving, the solver will continously print out the current time taken and the generation number it is on (generation number resets on restart policy).
When the solver finds a solution, it will output this solution with the time taken to the user. If not, it will output the closest solution according to its fitness score with the fitness score.
This output will also be appended to the problem file.
